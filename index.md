  Hi, I'm Emil.
  I'm a software developer from Oakland, California.
  I currently work as a Technical Account Manager at <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/" target="_blank">RudderStack</a>, enabling developers to solve complex customer data problems.
  My interests include programming, data, analytics, and machine learning.
  Some technologies I've been using lately are dbt, Prefect, Hex, Deno, and Upstash.
